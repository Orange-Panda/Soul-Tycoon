## About
Soul Tycoon is developed for the [44th Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/44). 
The theme for the game jam was **"your life is currency"**
This game was a solo project including all sound and art (if that part wasn't obvious :P).
This has been submitted into the "compo" category.
I tried to document my code as much as possible to allow novice programmer to understand what is going on.
